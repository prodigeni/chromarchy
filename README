CHROMARCHY

  Chromarchy is a GNU/Linux distribution for Chromebooks.  It builds on Arch
  Linux and Arch Linux ARM by providing a distribution installer and by
  providing packages for software included in Google's Chromium OS and
  Chrome OS.

PURPOSE

  Chrome OS and Chromium OS include software useful for the operation of
  Chromebook devices.  The power manager and audio server are great examples
  of this, as they are both simple, powerful, efficient, and tailored
  specifically to Chromebooks.  Chromarchy decouples these and other tools
  from Chrome/Chromium OS and integrates them into a more traditional
  GNU/Linux distribution.

  Chrome OS also depends on proprietary software for certain functionality
  like graphics hardware support.  Chromarchy might facilitate the use of
  these blobs in a more traditional setting.  Support for Flash and
  accelerated OpenGL may be possible and is a goal.

STATUS

  Chromarchy is currently in alpha status.  There is currently only support
  for Samsung ARM Chromebooks and HP Chromebook 11s, but support for other
  devices is planned.

SUPPORT

  You can support Chromarchy by

    - Using it and reporting issues.

    - Implementing and submitting support for other Chromebook devices.

    - Donating to offset costs of hosting and device acquisition.
      Donations are accepted via PayPal (tom@fancydriving.org) or
      Bitcoin (1Dv6CsyxFEwUrJdqVYegvey6oGTJ6h8j4b).

PACKAGE REPOSITORY

  Free packages are provided through the Chromarchy repository at
  ftp://ftp.chromium.org/.  Non-free packages are built from Chrome OS
  recovery images through AUR.

  To use the Chromarchy repository, add to /etc/pacman.conf before the stock
  repositories

    [chromarchy]
    Server = ftp://ftp.chromarchy.org/armv7h/$repo

INSTALLER

  A primitive and fragile installer, chromarchy_install, is available in
  this repository.  The installer

    - Partitions the target storage device and creates only a kernel and
      a root partition.

    - Creates a minimal bootstrap environment in /bootstrap containing only
      the files necessary to run pacman.

    - Installs the packages needed to build/install the Chromarchy packages.

    - Installs Chromarchy packages and enables Chromarchy services.

  The installer can be run from Chrome OS or any reasonable GNU/Linux
  distribution.  Installing to the internal SSD is a two-stage process, as
  the final installation must be run from an external USB or MMC storage
  device.

  Usage: chromarchy_install -b BOARD -u USB_DEVICE [-r REPO]
         chromarchy_install -b BOARD -m MMC_DEVICE [-r REPO]

  The supported boards are "daisy" (for Samsung ARM Chromebooks) and
  "daisy-spring" (for HP Chromebook 11s)

  Examples:

   - To install to the USB device at /dev/sda
     sudo bash chromarchy_install -b daisy-spring -u /dev/sda
   - To install to the internal SSD from a USB device
     sudo bash chromarchy_install -b daisy-spring -m /dev/mmcblk0

  After booting into your Chromarchy installation, you'll still need to set
  up your locales, timezone, etc. for which the Arch installation guide at
  https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_Guide may be helpful.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FROM CHROMEOS

  Your Chromebook must be in developer mode.  Instructions for enabling
  developer mode can be found at
  http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-information-for-chrome-os-devices

  Once in developer mode, you need to enable booting from external drives.
  To do so from ChromeOS

    1. Press Ctrl-Alt-T to open a crosh session
    2. Start a shell session:
       crosh> shell
    3. Enable external booting:
       sudo crossystem dev_boot_usb=1

  In developer mode, your Chromebook will display a splash screen instead of
  booting immediately.  At the splash screen, you can press Ctrl-D to boot
  from internal storage or Ctrl-U to boot from an external SD card or USB
  drive.

  With developer mode and external booting enabled, to install Chromarchy,

    1. Press Ctrl-Alt-T to open a crosh session
    2. Start a shell session:
       crosh> shell
    3. Change to your home directory:
       cd ~
    4. Download the intaller:
       wget https://raw.github.com/tsowell/chromarchy/master/chromarchy_install
    5. Install Chromarchy to the USB drive (Samsung ARM Chromebook):
       sudo bash chromarchy_install -b daisy -u /dev/sda
       Or install Chromarchy to the USB drive (HP Chromebook 11):
       sudo bash chromarchy_install -b daisy-spring -u /dev/sda
    6. Reboot the Chromebook and press Ctrl-U at the splash screen to boot
       into Chromarchy

SELECTED INFORMATION ON SELECTED PACKAGES

  chromeos-recovery-$BOARD

    The chromeos-recovery packages download recovery images from Google and
    keep them in /usr/share/chromeos-recovery.  Other non-free packages
    mount or otherwise tap into the image to facilitate the installation of
    non-free Chrome OS software.

    Building and installing the package involves several redundant
    extractions and archivings of the large image file which takes some
    time.

    This package is only available in the Arch Linux AUR.

  vboot-utils

    Provides tools for working with verified boot.  cgpt creates and
    modifies GPT headers and partitions.  

  chromeos-devkeys

    Installs from the recovery image the keys used by linux-chromeos to sign
    the kernel image.

    This package is only available in the Arch Linux AUR.

  linux-chromeos and linux-firmware-chromeos

    The kernel image and binary modules are installed to the filesystem from
    the recovery image.  The kernel is not installed to a kernel partition,
    but a simple script, linux-chromeos-install, is provided to do so.

    Usage: linux-chromeos-install DEVICE PARTITION PARTITION-NUMBER

    Example:

     - To install to /dev/sda1
       sudo linux-chromeos-install /dev/sda /dev/sda1 1

    linux-chromeos-install uses the command-line arguments installed in
    /boot/cmdline which do _not_ contain a root argument, and you must add
    one in order to boot the kernel.  UUIDs are preferred, especially if
    booting from a removable device.  You can find the UUIDs of your
    partitions by running "cgpt show $DEVICE" and add it to the command-line
    arguments by adding "root=PARTUUID=$UUID" to
    /boot/cmdline-linux-chromeos.

    The installer handles this for you.

    This package is only available in the Arch Linux AUR.

  chromiumos-power-manager

    The Chromium OS power manager.  Detailed information is available at
    http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/packages/power_manager

    backlight_tool can query and change the screen's backlight brightness.

    power_supply_info prints power supply information.

  cras-$BOARD

    The Chromium OS audio server masks the complexity of the audio controls
    presented by traditional ALSA.  It also automatically switches between
    headphone and speaker outputs based on audio plug status.

  xf86-input-cmt and libgestures

    Provide touchpad support.  One-finger, two-finger, and three-finger
    clicking are functional, but two-finger scrolling is currently not.

  chromarchy-xorg-conf-$BOARD

    Installs device-specific Xorg configuration files including touchpad and
    graphics driver parameters.

  chromeos-pepper-flash

    Installs Pepper Flash from the recovery image.  The Netflix helper
    doesn't work (at least) out of the box, but it may be possible to remedy
    that.

    This package is only available in the Arch Linux AUR.
