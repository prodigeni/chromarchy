CHROMARCHY

  Chromarchy is a GNU/Linux distribution for Chromebooks.  It builds on Arch
  Linux and Arch Linux ARM by providing a distribution installer and by
  providing packages for software included in Google's Chromium OS and
  Chrome OS.

PURPOSE

  Chrome OS and Chromium OS include software useful for the operation of
  Chromebook devices.  The power manager and audio server are great examples
  of this, as they are both simple, powerful, efficient, and tailored
  specifically to Chromebooks.  Chromarchy decouples these and other tools
  from Chrome/Chromium OS and integrates them into a more traditional
  GNU/Linux distribution.

  Chrome OS also depends on proprietary software for certain functionality
  like graphics hardware support.  Chromarchy might facilitate the use of
  these blobs in a more traditional setting.  Support for Flash and
  accelerated OpenGL may be possible and is a goal.

STATUS

  Chromarchy is currently in alpha status.  There is currently only support
  for Samsung ARM Chromebooks and HP Chromebook 11s, but support for other
  devices is planned.

INSTALLING

  A primitive and fragile installer, chromarchy_install, is available in
  this repository.  The installer

    - Partitions the target storage device and creates only a kernel and
      root partition.

    - Creates a minimal bootstrap environment in /bootstrap containing only
      the files necessary to run pacman.

    - Installs the packages needed to build/install the Chromarchy packages.

    - Installs Chromarchy packages and enables Chromarchy services.

  The installer can be run from Chrome OS or any reasonable GNU/Linux
  distribution.  Installing to the internal SSD is a two-stage process, as
  the final installation must be run from an external USB or MMC storage
  device.

  Usage: chromarchy_install -b BOARD -u USB_DEVICE [-r REPO]
         chromarchy_install -b BOARD -m MMC_DEVICE [-r REPO]

  The supported boards are "daisy" (for Samsung ARM Chromebooks) and
  "daisy-spring" (for HP Chromebook 11s)

  Examples:

   - To install to the USB device at /dev/sda
     sudo bash chromarchy_install -b daisy-spring -u /dev/sda
   - To install to the internal SSD from a USB device
     sudo bash chromarchy_install -b daisy-spring -m /dev/mmcblk0

FREE AND NON-FREE PACKAGES

  Free packages are provided through the Chromarchy repository at
  ftp://ftp.chromium.org/.  Non-free packages are built from Chrome OS
  recovery images through AUR.

INFORMATION ON SELECTED PACKAGES

  chromeos-recovery-$BOARD

    The chromeos-recovery packages download recovery images from Google and
    keep them in /usr/share/chromeos-recovery.  Other non-free packages
    mount or otherwise tap into the image to facilitate the installation of
    non-free Chrome OS software.

    Building and installing the package involves several redundant
    extractions and archivings of the large image file which takes some
    time.

  chromiumos-power-manager

    backlight_tool can query and change the screen's backlight brightness.

  cras-$BOARD

    The Chromium OS audio server masks the complexity of the audio controls
    presented by traditional ALSA.  It also automatically switches between
    headphone and speaker outputs based on audio plug status.
